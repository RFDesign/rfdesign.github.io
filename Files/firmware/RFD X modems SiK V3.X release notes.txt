RFD X V3.X series modems SiK firmware version release log
Version
- 3.01

New
- Added support for regional compliance
- Added S parrameters for future SBUS pass through

Improved
- Radio configs for all data rates

Fixed

Notes

Version
- 3.06

New
- New AT commands for non linear channel hop sets on special systems
- New AT commands to diagnose missing calibration data
- Modem red LED flashes on start up if modem calibration data is not found
- Added country code display for locked modems

Improved
- Removed unused duplicate variable

Fixed

Fixed
- fixed minor diversity issue, preamble lengthened

Notes




Version
- 3.09

New
- SBUS input and output now working added sbus output types adjusted ppm<->SBUS timing to match external device changed radio config for 868 with 26Mhz crystal changed duty cycle limiting to read entire block for time
- add new radio configs for 26Mhz xtal ad new radio board types fo rnew ux variants get xtal frequency dynamically

Improved
-changed 868 cap value and changed eu fixed params for 7 and 27db options

Fixed
- fix duty cycle limiting to never exceed value specified extend time frame to average duty change strings for gpio for SBUS change cap bank for 26Mhz xtal, needs changin later after real xtals obtained

Notes
- SBUS input and output now working added sbus output types adjusted ppm<->SBUS timing to match external device changed radio config for 868 with 26Mhz crystal changed duty cycle limiting to read entire block for time
- add new radio configs for 26Mhz xtal ad new radio board types fo rnew ux variants get xtal frequency dynamically




Version
- 3.10

New

Improved

Fixed

Notes
- fixes for rfd900sx build only no code changes for rfd900x/ux




Version
- 3.11

New

Improved

Fixed
- fix duty cycle again, round duty% up, make sure when tick is 0 no bug occurs, measure from start tx from start, and end from after tx in code a little later. Duty shows up to be 9.x% for all bands tested when 10% duty set.

Notes




Version
- 3.12

New
- Support for new frequencies on 868 modems to suite Indian bands

Improved

Fixed

Notes

Notes

Version
- 3.14

New
- provide support for 900x 26Mhz version of radio
- added sbus1 output option with no signal when link lost

Improved
- Updated maximum frequency to 867MHz; Maxium number of channels set to 8, default 6

Fixed
- make sure duty cycle does not engage when set to 100

Notes




Version
- 3.15
