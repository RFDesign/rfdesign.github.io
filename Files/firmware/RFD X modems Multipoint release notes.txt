Version 
- 2.77MP

New

Improved
- change range check for uneeded cal parameters
- added new radio configs for compliance fixed channel hop to ensure all nodes use all channels

Fixed
- fix rssi not reading tx slot filled with empty data for testing
- fixes for radio sensitivity from SiK branch. Splatter fixed and dat rate fixed
- si446x bug fix, SPI FIFO pull causes sensitivity loss at low power. changed packet size to 120 bytes payload 4 bytes id on air, 120 = 6 trailer, 114 data. mav packet parser tries to send whole packets separated into the current slot. Sas parser limits data size of payload to 114 bytes, larger sizes will be discarded serial break will attempt to fit into current slot if it can raw data will send whatever is available

- changed to remove window from trailer, only used during sync now. Changed sync margin to 10 for master and 15 for backup or .25 or .375 of window only display sync errors larger than 4 ticks set tx holdoff time to zero, didn't change timing.
- working on MP timing

Fixed

- merge closer to main, extend preamble to 11 bytes fix diversity
- fix for diversity broken
- fixed bug with sensitivity loss after tx, removed unused gpios
Notes

Notes

Version 
- 2.85MP

New
- added number of networks to fixed country params
- added heap size define to project
- added buffersize parameter for serial buffer size
- assert added in to force reset
- added checks to ensure cts pin does not stay high 
- added check to tx setup and delay times
- added watchdog to kill if end of main loop not reached often enough (i.e. tx some data) watchdog now 4 seconds to allow for master device first time start up around entire channel set before tx

Improved
- changed some defaults
- serial driver changed to dynamic allocation of buffers

Fixed
- changed default min and max freq back to standard
- fix issue with duty cycle stopping radio working. Need to test duty cycle under high temp conditions
